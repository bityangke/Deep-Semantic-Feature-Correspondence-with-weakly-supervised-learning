This is a project for solving "image semantic matching" by End-to-end Convolutional Neural Network with weakly-supervised learning.
The main reference paper includes "Convolutional Neural Network Architecture for Geometric Matching"[1] in CVPR-2017, "End-to-end weakly-supervised semantic alignment"[2] in CVPR-2018
and "Neighbourhood Consensus Networks"[3] in NIPS-2018.
